      Another writing challenge can be to take the individual sentences in the random paragraph and
      incorporate a single sentence from that into a new paragraph to create a short story.
      Unlike the random sentence generator, the sentences from the random paragraph will have
      some connection to one another so it will be a bit different.
      You also won't know exactly how many sentences will appear in the random paragraph.

      Another productive way to use this tool to begin a daily writing routine.
      One way is to generate a random paragraph with the intention to try to rewrite it while still keeping the original meaning.
      The purpose here is to just get the writing started so that when the writer goes onto their day's writing projects,
      words are already flowing from their fingers.
